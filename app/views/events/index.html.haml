        %p This is a simple guide to most of the hardcore/punk shows that are happening now in Zagreb. 
        %p Information is automatically fetched from a online group calendar where 25+ people involved in doing punk shows are posting events they're doing while trying not to step on each others feet.
        %p This should be as comprehensive as it gets, although there's not a 100% guarantee that every single show will be listed. 
        %p People organizing these shows stand I00% against fascism, nationalism, patriotsm, homophobia and any kind of fake pride.
        %p Hopefully you'll find this useful.
